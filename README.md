Edit to Le-Chat. Themed by me for chat.evilcorp.ga.
## Notes for dusty
1. IDK how your files are setup... but if u could figure out if u need to replace files or whatever make it work :P...or let me know how to make it work.
2. If you would like could get this index.html as chat.evilcorp.ga, it will all just work. Also if you do that make sure the chat.php is chat.evilcorp.ga/chat , but if you use all these files it'll all be fine. If you dont want an index just coppy /asset/img to your websites dir.
3. Give Admin to nicks Dusted and TripleZer0. If you do not know how it is within your admin settings via the chat if you are set up as "Owner"
...any questions pm me
